In addition, because none of this is associated with our university addresses, we are not subject to FOIAs, so we can say dumb things without the threat of being taken down for it. yeo! we can share the codes `inline = rnorm(1,1,1)` and in blocks ``` blocks = rnorm(100, 1, 1) ``` And, things stay in places that make sense. There are presently two additional channels to keep things straight. <#C16S81202> and <#C16RM7TD2> “subscribe" to those if you haven’t. Also, the phone and desktop clients are nice. sup <@U16S9N0LE> sup <@U16RAECF5> Another thought… because who doesn’t have time for more thoughts… There is a lot of working being done right now about evaluating the “gender tone” of job posts, resumes, etc. For example, work being done by <https://textio.com/> that is running things past a sentiment and gender filter on a bag of words. Possible for ballots when they come out? Candidate position statements? This is non-expermiental work, and probably just mostly sensational work that would be headed for the news cycle not a journal, but it is pretty low-hanging fruit. I bet that we could even get them to task an intern onto collecting the corpus of text for us as well. Not for this election. That would have to be scraped, unfortunately. The Making Electoral Democracy Work project has press releases for campaigns in Britain and Canada for the last few elections but that corpus probably isn’t as interesting.
