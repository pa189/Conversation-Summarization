My first thought was to use this to examine candidate press releases. I wonder about the extent to which the gender tone of these statement varies across parties and/or according to the gender of the candidate. Does a current corpus exist? Would love to know how Trump comes out in a mysogeny (sp???) score. I dunno, Trudeauâ€™s campaign was pretty awesome. <@U16RAECF5>: we doing that evidence review today? yrp. I just finished a review, I'm going to give Devesh a quick call, then get on it.
