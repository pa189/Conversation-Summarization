I’m jealous. <@U16RAECF5> and I have nothing but *hard* sandbagging by our Mission contacts... That seems the norm <@U16TY5M6F>: can we use any of this data to build the IRT ranking model? Probably. What's the underlying concept? <@U1CCHNQ3V>: Where you at bro? In SD this week, so is Chris, so is Micah. Sup with it? <@U16RLTH3N>: I need to download the app on my phone so I get these messages instantly. But I'm gonna get some drinks with <@U16RAECF5> Hey <@U16RAECF5> and <@U1CCHNQ3V>: Try this out for a recommendation when you get your beers. The story about how it was made is linked, and the recommender is at the bottom of the linked page. <http://willnetsky.github.io/Beer-Recommender/> It’s a pretty simple recommender -- seems to just key on most descriptive word. This is a little tough, because while there are a lot of nerds who rate beer, there are a lot of bros who know like 4 beer words: “dank”, “fruit”, “sour”, ... . And, this sort of mainlines the recommendations. I think a little filtering would help clean this up. Also, some rankings. Checked it out. I'm into it. Two syllabi that my be of interest: Matt Blackwell: <http://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov2002-15f-syllabus.pdf> and Danny Hidalgo: <http://www.mit.edu/~dhidalgo/syllabi/17_802_syll2014.pdf>. MR_WHITE pointed out that Hidalgo is more interested in observational data. Nice bibliography between the two. <@U16RY7PR6>: Can I share the PSU irb material --- specifically the short part where you dared PSU to not grant exempt status --- with <@U16RAECF5> and <@U1CCHNQ3V>? <@U1CCHNQ3V> is putting together an encouragement design intervention right now. I bet he’ll share back his completed documents, too? <@U16RY7PR6>: <@U16RLTH3N> <@U16RAECF5> and I would be happy to share the completed documents <@U16RLTH3N>: <@U16RAECF5> <@U1CCHNQ3V> Totally! I have a folder full of IRBs and you are welcome to any of them. I think that one that MR_WHITE has probably contains the sharpest language. <@U1CCHNQ3V>: I just uploaded the doc I’m sending to Berkelye. On helping people understand the value of experimental research: I've been thinking a lot about the push back that MR_WHITE and I got in designing a useful intervention. Today again I was talking to someone who has the opportunity to learn about a program's effectiveness, but instead is waving their hands talking nonsense. Has anyone seen a good attempt at explaining the value of experimental research to a non-technical audience? <@U16RAECF5>: Unfortunately, no. I looked for something like this when I was reviewing a proposal for the National Opinion Research Center but couldn’t find anything like it. The proposed intervention was sooooooooooooooooo bad. <@U16RAECF5>: Also, I’m working out responses to your emails. One of them is almost perfectly in line with something that I just spoke with Matt Golder about earlier today. It was like you read my mind. Spooky. :grinning:
