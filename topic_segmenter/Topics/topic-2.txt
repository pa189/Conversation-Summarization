k. iâ€™m there too... Is anybody mailing stamps to all-mail states? Perhaps for the general election the feds are taking care of postage, but for primaries people still have to pay postage (because it is not _strictly_ federal elections). Dammit, we should have done that. That would have been a sweet intervention. Wait. It is still necessary to buy postage for mail in ballots in the general election. <http://about.usps.com/election-mail/election-mail-dmm-sheet.pdf> So, mailing addresses, Oregon, GOTV messages, stamps.
