Yup. Those are going to be HELLA high fidelity because they are an all mail state. Additional treatment condition: mailing 2x the postage that is necessary, building in an explicit spillover on co-residents. That would be dope. No one has done this in the past? Seems like something Green/Gerber would have stumbled on at some point. If not, it is pretty sweet. No possible harms that I can imagine.
