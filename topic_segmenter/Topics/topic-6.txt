I dunno. Seems so low hanging. SO low hanging. Here’s the closest I can find. From 2015. A natural experiment in Switzerland. <http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/123257/1/cesifo_wp5617.pdf> Doesn’t have any citations to work that have manipulated postage. But, it doesn’t look exactly exhaustive. Yeah, that’s a short review. It is a shame that one of us doesn’t know Green, Gerber, or Sinclair. They would probably know. I know both Green and Sinclair well enough that they would answer my emails. Ah, I shouldn’t have assumed. Might be something to run by them. <http://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-4-16> But, I should be writing a dissertation...
